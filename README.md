This is a system that enables interactive image generation and editing.

## Preparation
To run the program, an API key from OpenAI is required.<br>
After obtaining the API key, input it as a string in the code at line 52 of the program, where it says "# input your API_KEY here."
```
API_KEY = # input your API_KEY here
```
Run the following command.
```
conda create −n env python=3.8
conda activate env
pip install −r requirements_gcp.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/IDEA−Research/GroundingDINO.git
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment−anything.git
